_Overview_
This repository explores advanced statistical methods for goodness-of-fit testing, density estimation, and distribution modeling. It combines simulation-based approaches with theoretical insights to analyze location-scale Student’s t-distributions and related models.
Key Features

Goodness-of-Fit Tests: Comparative study of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Anderson-Darling (AD) tests for unspecified location-scale t-distributions using Monte Carlo simulations.
Density Estimation: Evaluation of inversion theorem, convolution formula, and Gaussian kernel density estimation for sums of t-distributed variables.
Risk Metrics: Expected Shortfall (ES) estimation with confidence intervals via parametric and non-parametric bootstrapping.
Optimization Algorithms: Performance analysis of BFGS and iterative methods for Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
Multivariate Distributions: Simulation-based confirmation of conditional properties of multivariate Student’s t-distribution and modeling of non-elliptic distributions (mixed Laplace, non-central t).
Real-World Application: Model fitting and comparison using Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) data.
